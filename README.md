# saml-rs

A library for doing SAML things, terribly, in rust.

This library's in a lot of flux right now, if you're using it from Github then... sorry? Once it's published as a crate you'll have a relatively stable target, as much as that'll help?

My main aim at the moment is to provide IdP capabilities for the [Kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) project, if you want to help - please log PRs/Issues against [terminaloutcomes/saml-rs](https://github.com/terminaloutcomes/saml-rs).
