# saml-rs

A library for doing SAML things, terribly, in rust.

This library's in a lot of flux right now, if you're using it from Github then... sorry? Once it's published as a crate you'll have a relatively stable target, as much as that'll help?

My main aim at the moment is to provide IdP capabilities for the [Kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) project, if you want to help - please log PRs/Issues against [terminaloutcomes/saml-rs](https://github.com/terminaloutcomes/saml-rs).

# Documentation

The automatically-generated documentation based on the `main` branch is here: https://terminaloutcomes.github.io/saml-rs/saml_rs/


# Generating the SAML keys for the test server.

You'll need cloudflare's SSL toolkit [cloudflare/ssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl).

This assumes you're running it from `~/certs`

## Create a config.json

```json
{
    "hosts": [
        "example.com"
    ],
    "key": {
        "algo": "rsa",
        "size": 2048
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C":  "AU",
            "L":  "The Internet",
            "O":  "Example Org",
            "OU": "SAML",
            "ST": "Somewhere"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running commands

This generates a CA cert, then signs a certificate for it with the same name. It's janky but it works.

```
cfssl genkey -initca config.json | cfssljson -bare ca

```

You end up with files you can specify in the config here:

```
"saml_cert_path" : "~/certs/cert.pem",
"saml_key_path" : "~/certs/cert-key.pem"
```
